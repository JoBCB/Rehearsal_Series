# Rehearsal_Series
Rehearsal Series is a workshop methodology a cross-disciplinary exploration of choreography with design thinking and computer programming developed by [Joana Chicau.](http://joanachicau.com)

By 'rehearsal' it is meant a temporary stage for experimenting with digital design tools which follow choreographic methods and conceptual concerns. Traditionally, a rehearsal is a built-in process, a space-time for developing ideas and work acknowledging unexpected and unpredictable results. This format is very similar to an open workshop, open to any participants curious to explore the use of choreographic techniques to generate new modes of thinking composition matters, participation, relations and articulations between bodies and technologies. 

In every rehearsal a specific topic and set of tools is addressed which serves as a starting point for the construction of a 'choreographic code'. During the rehearsals, the participants are presented to various choreographic references, examples of scores and scripts, and participate in basic movement studies. Finally, participants are invited to contribute to the choreographic code: by translating the ideas discussed into design and programming logic.
