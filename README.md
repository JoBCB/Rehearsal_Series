# Rehearsal_Series
Rehearsal Series is a workshop methodology a cross-disciplinary exploration of choreography with design thinking and computer programming developed by [Joana Chicau.](http://joanachicau.com)



By 'rehearsal' it is meant a temporary stage for experimenting with digital design tools which follow choreographic methods and thematic concerns. Traditionally, a rehearsal is a built in process, a space and time for developing ideas and work acknowledging unexpected and unpredictable results. This format is very similar to an open workshop, open to any participants curious to explore the use of choreographic techniques to generate new modes of thinking composition matters, participation, relations and articulations between bodies and technologies.

An important point about the Rehearsal Series is to break the distancing between mind/body, self/other, subject/object, designer/design piece; discovery/invention. Enhancing the idea of process over product: processes of becoming, becoming structures, becoming codes and scripts.

In every rehearsal a selection of topics will be addressed and will serve as starting point to the construction of a choreographic code. During the rehearsals, the participants will be presented to various choreographic references, examples of scores and scripts, and participate in basic movement studies. Finally, all participants are invited to contribute to the choreographic code: by translating the ideas discussed into design and programming logic.
