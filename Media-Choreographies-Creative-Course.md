 ## Media Choreographies 
 
 _Creative Course at [IIT Jammu](https://iitjammu.ac.in/hss_engineering) — September 2020_
 
> Choreographies are socio-cultural constructions, critics to current systems, political positions or dispositions, alternatives to move or counter-move. Each epoch, each place, each culture, each instance of choreography resists and reform previous conceptions of its definition. 
As in choreography, computer programming deals with space, time and movement constructs. And it has been defining ways of moving collectively or individually, through fluid nonetheless complex landscapes of information displays, networked spaces, and multi-media environments. — [Joana Chicau, Choreo-graphic-hypothesis publication](https://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Choreo-graphic-hypothesis-web-joana-chicau.pdf)


### 23rd September — 10.30AM - 2.30PM CET / 2 PM - 5PM IST 
 
#### Introduction to tutor Joana Chicau — 15min;
 
Joana Chicau is a graphic designer, coder, independent researcher — with a background in dance. Her trans-disciplinary project interweaves web programming languages and environments with choreographic practices. 
In her practice she researches the intersection of the body with the constructed, designed, programmed environment, aiming at in widening theways in which digital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public. 
She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.

 #### Introduction to the theme — 30min;
 
 __WHAT IS CHOREOGRAPHY?__

_choreography in Greek is spelled χορογραφια from χορός (dance) + γραφια (writing)_

 
<br><br> 

__::::::: EXERCISE 01 — max. 45 min :::::::__


In groups, read the text: [Choreographic Objects by William Forsythe](http://www.williamforsythe.com/essay.html); and write your own definition. Give an example of a choreography you have encountered this week.

Presentation of one idea and one example per group.

<br><br> 

Quotes from the same author:

> "Choreography is the term that presides over a class of ideas: an idea is perhaps in this case a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action."

> "Choreographies model uncertain outcomes";

> "Choreographies traject ideas into the action of perception";

> "Choreographies may also refuse to act";

> "Choreographies suspend certainty";

> "Choreographies valorize failure";


<br><br> 

__::::::: EXERCISE 02 — max. 1 hour :::::::__


__Choreographing and Being choreographed__ a discussion on how movement, gestures, discourses, and behaviours are choreographed and communicated through the apparatuses. 

_15 min_

1) Analyse the poster ['Scores & Scripts — a Bestiary of Intents'](https://www.ppig.org/files/2017-PPIG-28th-church.pdf);

2) Do you agree with the categories? And examples underneath each category?

_30 min_

3) Each group member adds a new example from one of the categories: 

  * human to < — > human choreography; 

  * human to — > machine choreography; 

  * machine to — > human choreography; 

  * machine to  <— > machine choreography;
 
4) Discuss in the group why you believe your example connects to the category you chose;

_15 min_

5) The group selects one example and present to the whole class;

__::::::: EXERCISE 05 | Assignment :::::::__ — 40min + break 20min + 40min +  break 20min + 30min;

_Description:_ in groups, create a piece of “choreographic code” by translating the ideas discussed in the class into programming logic. 

  * Choose a computational process (you can work with any data type, better to start with a simple one, and with not too many steps);

  * Define the 'choreographic viewpoint' you would like to explore; for example: 
     - temporality (duration,  explore different rhythms, tempo: smooth/flowing versus very slowly or fast; - repetition; - simultanity or different forms of temporal relationality…)
     - spatiality (position, scale, layers, - distances between objects; - one body or element in relation to another, to a group, or to the architecture; - topography: the movement over a pattern, symmetry versus asymmetry,..)
     - sequence: unpredictability, (non)linearity or random sequence..

  * Discuss in your group how to combine the computational process with a choreographic viewpoint; how will the code perform?

  * Sketch your ideas in written form: it can be either a text, drawing, schema, geometric shapes, a code snippet,...

<br> 

__Deliverables:__ — to be sent over email by the end of the session;

_Format:_ 1 PDF file (max. 5 pages) — must contain: 

  * short description of the outcome and short reflection (max. 800 words);
  
  * short list references and bibliography; 
  
  * any other relevant material for understanding the process and results, such as images, or links to multimedia material;
  
  * students names;
